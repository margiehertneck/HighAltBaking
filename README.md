#High Altitude Baking Adjustments Calculator
*M Hertneck, June 7, 2015*

The high altitude baking adjustments calculator located at: 
  
<https://margiehertneck.shinyapps.io/HighAltBaking>  
  
  converts the time and temperature in a recipe for more successful baking at high altitude.  High altitude is considered 3000 feet, and bakers who live at or above this threshold must make adjustments to their baking recipes.  This calculator makes that easier. 

Simply follow the instructions on the left side of the screen, using your recipe to input the time, temperature and whether your baking product is primarily chocolate or a delicate item, such as those that use meringue for more loft in the batter.

*Note that this calculator is in beta and the user assumes all risk for using it.  There are no guarantees on your results.*
